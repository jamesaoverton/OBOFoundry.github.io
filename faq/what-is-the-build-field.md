## What does the build object do in my YAML configuration

Most ontology metadata files contain a `build` field (see other FAQ
entries for how to view and edit metadata files).

For example, the [mouse anatomy](/ontology/ma.html) yaml file `ma.md` has the following:

```
...
build:
  source_url: ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/adult_mouse_anatomy.obo
  method: obo2owl
...
```

These are instructions for the central OBO library build pipeline which
runs nightly. This ensures creation of correct obo and owl files for
each ontology.

The output goes here:

 * http://berkeleybop.org/ontologies/

You can choose to entirely ignore the output of this pipeline for your
ontology. However, it provides a convenient fall-through for groups
who are not running their own release pipelines. Historically many
groups in OBO have just produced a single obo file, e.g. on their ftp
site, and the central build has ensured owl and roundtripped obo (as
well as additional services such as validation).

## Where does the job run?

The continuous integration job runs here:

 * http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/simple-build-obo-all/

It takes as metadata input the yml file from this repository. It makes
use of the `build` object.

This job will fail if ontologies marked as `infallible` fail. To debug, the full log of the last build can be examined:

 * https://build.berkeleybop.org/job/simple-build-obo-all/lastBuild/consoleFull

(Look for the text "should not fail")

## Warning

A  http://berkeleybop.org/ontologies/ URL should never be handed out directly. This service exists so that:

 * Un PURL-registered ontologies will have a fall-through
 * Registered PURL ontologies that do not want to take charge of either OBO or OWL generation will have a place to 302-redirect to

## What are some of the methods?

The build object takes a number of different methods:

 * obo2owl: creates a release folder using an obo file as source
 * owl2obo: creates a release folder using an owl file as source
 * archive: copies a release folder (e.g. from an existing CI job) to the bbop ontology repository
 * vcs: does a git or svn checkout and copies the resulting folder

For more details, ask a question on the tracker or see the script:

## How do I take control of my own builds

You do not need to rely on the OBO central builds!

You can use an existing tool like
[robot](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/) and a Makefile. See some
existing github repositories for examples.

You would make your own releases (I recommend using the github release mechanism)

You can then configure your ontology entries in OCLC to point to the
location in your repository (or to where you choose to release them, e.g. S3)
